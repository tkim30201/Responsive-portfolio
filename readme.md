In this this project, I developed a portfolio site. 
I created three files: index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html.
Each page has a navbar that contains links to the other two pages.
The navbar was created using bootstrap cdn and code from the page.
The navbar is consistent on each page.
Each page utilizes grid system.
The about page contains personalized information, as well as a photo of me.
